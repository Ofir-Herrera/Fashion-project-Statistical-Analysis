# Fashion-project-Statistical-Analysis

## Overview
This project predicts whether a fashion item from the Shein website is "Good" or "Bad" based on product attributes and data from similar items with reviews.  
The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) for classification.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project is organized into separate Jupyter notebooks for each stage:
